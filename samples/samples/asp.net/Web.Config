				maxRequestLength is in KB units.  2151 KB is just over 2 MB, this ensures that
				a 2 MB plus some other POST overhead will be accepted. The default is 4 MB. The
				maximum value is 2097151 for .Net 2.0 and 1048576 for .Net 1.x.
				
				executionTimeout is in seconds.  It should be long enough for the entire to be uploaded
				and for page execution to complete.
