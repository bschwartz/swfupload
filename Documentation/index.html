	<h1>SWFUpload v2 Documentation</h1>
	<h2>SWFUpload</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.swfupload.org">SWFUpload</a> is a client-side file upload tool originally developed by <a href="http://www.vinterwebb.se/">Vinterwebb.se</a>. It uses a combination of Flash and JavaScript to
		provide file upload functionality beyond what the basic browser provides with the &lt;input type="file" /&gt; tag.
	</p>
	<p>The main features that SWFUpload provides are:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The ability to select multiple files in the file browser dialog.</li>
			<li>AJAX-style uploading without a page refresh.</li>
			<li>Upload progress events.</li>
			<li>Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers.</li>
			<li>Namespaced classes compatible with other JavaScript libraries (i.e., jQuery, Prototype, etc.).</li>
			<li>Flash 8 and Flash 9 support.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		SWFUpload is different from other Flash based upload tools because of the philosophy
		behind its design.  SWFUpload gives developers control by leaving the UI in the browser.
		Developers can use XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tailor the upload UI to the needs and
		style of their site.  Upload status updates are made through a set of simple JavaScript events.
		The developer uses these events to update the webpage as the file upload progresses.
	</p>
	
	<h2>SWFUpload v2</h2>
	<p>
		SWFUpload v2 includes new advanced features, improved stability, Flash Player
		bug work-arounds and a helpful set of Plug-ins. New features include:
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The ability to send additional POST values with the uploads (Flash 9 version).</li>
			<li>Sending per file POST/GET values.</li>
			<li>More intuitive events.</li>
			<li>Settings dynamically updateable.</li>
			<li>Retrieve result data from the server (Flash 9 version).</li>
			<li>Stop an upload without cancelling.</li>
			<li>Upload files out of order.</li>
			<li>Multi- &amp; Single-file selection dialogs.</li>
			<li>Queue size, files uploaded and file size limits.</li>
			<li>Properly handles zero-byte files.</li>
			<li>Pre-upload validation event.</li>
			<li>Work-arounds for bugs in Flash not addressed in v1.0.2.</li>
			<li>Bug fixes from v1.0.2:
				<ul>
					<li>Flash fails to load on reload in I.E.</li>
					<li>Flash fails to load on reload in Firefox unless the windows is scrolled back to the top.</li>
					<li>Race-conditions when files are cached.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>ASP.Net Forms compatibility</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		SWFUpload v2 continues the SWFUpload design goal of leaving the UI in the hands of developers and extends it even further.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<h3>HTML Upload</h3>
	<p>
		The standard HTML upload input box provides a box and a button to the user for selecting a file.
		The file is submitted with the form.  The entire file must be uploaded before the next
		page is displayed.  No pre-upload validation can be made on the file (e.g., file size limits or valid extensions).
		Very little feedback is given to the user while the file uploads.
	</p>
	<p>
		The usage pattern for standard HTML uploads is simple, straight forward, and supported by nearly all browser.
	</p>
	<h3>SWFUpload</h3>
	<p>
		SWFUpoad uses a hidden Flash movie to handle file selection and upload.  JavaScript is used to activate the file selection dialog.
		The file selection dialog is configured to allow the user select to a single file or to multiple files.
		The file types can be restricted so users only select the appropriate files (e.g., *.jpg;*.gif).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once files are selected each is processed and validated.  As the file is processed and upload by Flash
		JavaScript events are fired which the developer overrides in order to update the page UI. Providing
		upload status and error messages in real-time.
	</p>
	<p>
		The uploaded file is submitted separately from the rest of the page and form.  Each file is uploaded
		individually which keeps the server-side upload handling script simple as it only has to handle a
		single uploaded file at a time. Since Flash is providing the upload service the page does not have to
		be submitted or reloaded.  The usage pattern for SWFUpload is more like that of an AJAX application than that of
		a standard HTML form.  The page's form will be processed separately from the file upload.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>SWFUpload is not a drag &amp; drop upload control.  It requires knowledge of JavaScript and the DOM.  Several demos are available that
	show what some things SWFUpload is capable of and how to accomplish common tasks.</p>
	
	<p>SWFUpload consists of 4 pieces:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Initialization and Settings</li>
		<li>JavaScript library: SWFUpload.js</li>
		<li>Flash Control: SWFUpload_f8.swf or SWFupload_f9.swf</li>
		<li>The Event Handlers</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Most problems implementing SWFUpload are caused by incorrect settings or poorly built event handlers.</p>
	
	<h3>Initialization and Settings</h3>
	<p>SWFUpload must be initialized on the page.  This is commonly done in the window.onload event.  The SWFUpload constructor requires a settings object.
	The settings object is often passed directly to the constructor as an object literal.</p>
	<p>A reference to the initialized SWFUpload object should be kept as it is needed to display the File Selection Dialog and to start uploads.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> Initializing SWFUpload with an object literal</p>
	
	<code>var swfu;
	
window.onload = function () {
	swfu = new SWFUpload({
		upload_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/upload.php",
		flash_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/swfupload_f9.swf",
		file_size_limit : "20480"
	});
};</code>

	<p><strong>Example:</strong> Initializing SWFUpload with a settings object stored in a variable</p>

	<code>var swfu;
	
window.onload = function () {
	var settings_object = {
		upload_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/upload.php",
		flash_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/swfupload_f9.swf",
		file_size_limit : "20480"
	};
	
	swfu = new SWFUpload(settings_object);
};</code>

	<h3>JavaScript library</h3>
	<p>The JavaScript library file (swfupload.js) should be included on the page where the user will interact and upload pages.  It is compatible
	with both Flash Player 8 and Flash Player 9 SWFUpload versions.</p>
	<p>Once a SWFUpload object has been created access to several functions become available which allow the developer to control SWFUpload.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> Adding SWFUpload.js to a page</p>
	
	<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.swfupload.org/swfupload.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	</code>
	
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> Initializing SWFUpload with the required settings and binding selectFiles to a button.</p>
	<code>var swfu = new SWFUpload({
	upload_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/upload.php",
	flash_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/swfupload_f9.swf"
});

document.getElementById("BrowseButton").onclick = function () { swfu.selectFiles(); };
</code>

	<h3>Flash Control</h3>
	<p>The SWFUpload JavaScript library dynamically loads the Flash Control (swfupload_f8.swf/swfupload_f9.swf).  The Flash Control comes in two
	versions.  One version supports Flash Player 8 and greater.  It provides greater compatibility while sacrificing some features.  The other
	supports Flash Player 9.0.28 and greater.  It provides additional features while sacrificing compatibility with Flash Player 8 users.</p>
	
	<p>The location of the Flash Control file must be provide in the SWFUpload settings object during setup.</p>
	
	<p>The Flash Control is an invisible Flash Movie that handles file browsing, validation and upload.  It does not provide any User Interface
	components but communications with JavaScript to notify the browser when updates to the page need to be made.</p>
	
	<h3>The Event Handlers</h3>
	
	<p>Developers must create a set of JavaScript functions that handle SWFUpload events.  These functions are called as different important events occur.</p>
	
	<p>By handling the SWFUpload events developers can provide feedback regarding the upload progress, error messages, and upload completion.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> SWFUpload event handlers and initialization.</p>
	
	<code>// The uploadStart event handler.  This function variable is assigned to upload_start_handler in the settings object
var uploadStartEventHandler = function (file) {
	var continue_with_upload = true;
	
	return continue_with_upload;
};

// The uploadSuccess event handler.  This function variable is assigned to upload_success_handler in the settings object
var uploadSuccessEventHandler = function (file, server_data) {
	alert("The file " + file.name + " has been delivered to the server. The server responded with " + server_data);
};

// Create the SWFUpload Object
var swfu = new SWFUpload({
	upload_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/upload.php",
	flash_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/swfupload_f9.swf",
	file_size_limit : "20480",
	
	upload_start_handler : uploadStartEventHandler,
	upload_success_handler : uploadSuccessEventHandler
});</code>

	<hr />

	<h2>SWFUpload JavaScript Object</h2>

	<h3>Constructor</h3>

	<p><span class="function">SWFUpload(<span class="parameter">settings object</span>)</span></p>
	<p><b>Returns:</b> A SWFUpload instance</p>
	<code>var swfupload_instance = new SWFUpload(settings_object);</code>

	<h3>Globals and Constants</h3>
	<p>
		Several globals and constants are associated with the SWFUpload object. These are useful for
		advanced SWFUpload applications and for handling errors.  These are considered read-only.
	</p>
	<h4>SWFUpload.instances</h4>
	<p>SWFUpload.instances is an array containing a reference to each SWFUpload instance loaded on a page. The Flash Player
	relies on this array in order to call the correct event handlers.  SWFUpload.instances is indexed by the movieName property.</p>
	<p><em>Note:</em> SWFUpload.instances is not a true JavaScript array.  It is actually a simple object.</p>

	<h4>SWFUpload.movieCount</h4>
	<p>SWFUpoad.movieCount is a global that tracks the number on SWFUpload instances that have been created and helps to ensure each movie is
	given a unique movieName.</p>

	<h4>SWFUpload.QUEUE_ERROR</h4>
	<p>SWFUpload.QUEUE_ERROR is a simple object that contains Queue Error code constants.  It is generally used to determine which error code was sent
	in the fileQueueError event.</p>
	
	<h4>SWFUpload.UPLOAD_ERROR</h4>
	<p>SWFUpload.UPLOAD_ERROR is a simple object that contains Upload Error code constants.  It is generally used to determine which error code was sent
	in the uploadError event.</p>

	<h4>SWFUpload.FILE_STATUS</h4>
	<p>SWFUpload.FILE_STATUS is a simple object that contains File Status code constants.  It can be used to check the file status property on the File object.</p>

	<h4>Default Event handlers</h4>
	<p>The SWFUpload library provides a set of default event handlers. These are used by the library to ensure that something is available to call even when you do
	not define custom event handlers.  They should not be over-written when defining custom event handlers.  Custom event handlers should be defined separately 
	and bound using the settings object.</p>

	<h3>Properties</h3>
	<p>
		The following list of properties are intended for your use as described below. Using other properties or
		writing to read-only properties can cause SWFUpload to malfunction.
	</p>
	<h4>customSettings (read/write)</h4>
	<p>
		The customSettings property is an empty JavaScript object that can be used to store data associated with
		an instance of SWFUpload.  The customSettings' contents can be initialized using the custom_settings setting.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some plug-ins use the customSettings object for their internal operation.  Use caution when over-writing
	the entire customSettings object.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<code>// Initialize SWFUpload with some custom settings
var swfu = new SWFUpload({
	custom_settings : {
		custom_setting_1 : "custom_setting_value_1",
		custom_setting_2 : "custom_setting_value_2",
		custom_setting_n : "custom_setting_value_n",
	}
});

swfu.customSettings.custom_setting_1 = "custom_setting_value_1";	// Change an existing custom setting
swfu.customSettings.myNewCustomSetting = "new custom setting value";	// Add a new custom setting

// Overwrite the customSettings with a completely new object
swfu.customSettings = {
	custom_setting_A : "custom_setting_value_A",
	custom_setting_B : "custom_setting_value_B"
};
	</code>

	<h4>movieName</h4>
	<p>Contains the SWFUpload instance unique movie name.  This value is passed to Flash and is used to facilitate Flash to JavaScript communication.
	This value is used to index the instance in the SWFUpload.instances array.</p>

	<h3>Methods</h3>
	<p>The following methods are used to operate SWFUpload.  Some are bound to element (e.g., buttons) click event handlers and others are used inside
	SWFUpload event handlers.</p>
	
	<h4>object addSetting(<span class="parameter">setting_name</span>, <span class="parameter">value</span>, <span class="parameter">default_value</span>)</h4>
	<p>The addSetting function sets a setting value.  If the value is undefined then the default_value is used.  The function is used by SWFUpload
	during initialization.  Using addSetting to update a setting will not change the setting in the Flash Control.</p>
	<p>addSetting returns the value that was stored in the setting.</p>
	
	<h4>object getSetting(<span class="parameter">setting_name</span>)</h4>
	<p>The getSetting function retieves the value of a setting.  If the setting is not found an empty string is returned.</p>
	
	<h4>object retrieveSetting(<span class="parameter">setting_value</span>, <span class="parameter">default_value</span>)</h4>
	<p>The retrieveSetting function is similar to the addSetting function except it does not modify the internal settings object.  retrieveSetting
	returns the setting_value unless it is undefined in which case it returns the default_value</p>
	<p>This is a utility function.</p>
	
	<h4>void displayDebugInfo()</h4>
	<p>The displayDebugInfo outputs SWFUpload settings using the debug event.  This function is automatically called after initilization if the debug setting is 'true'</p>
	
	<h4>void selectFile()</h4>
	<p>selectFile causes the Flash Control to display a File Selection Dialog window.  A single file may be selected from the Dialog window.</p>
	<p>Calling selectFile begins the File Event Chain.</p>
	
	<h4>void selectFiles()</h4>
	<p>selectFiles causes the Flash Control to display a File Selection Dialog window.  A multiple files may be selected from the Dialog window.</p>
	<p>Calling selectFiles begins the File Event Chain.</p>

	<h4>void startUpload(<span class="parameter">file_id</span>)</h4>
	<p>startUpload causes the file specified by the file_id paramter to start the upload process.  If the file_id parameter is omitted or undefined then the first file in the queue is uploaded.</p>
	
	<p>Calling startUpload begins the Upload Event Chain.</p>
	
	<h4>void cancelUpload(<span class="parameter">file_id</span>)</h4>
	
	<p>cancelUpload cancels the file specified by the file_id parameter.  The file is then removed from the queue.</p>
	<p>If the file_id paramter is omitted or undefined then the first file in the queue is cancelled.</p>
	<p>If the file cancelled is currently being uploaded then the uploadError event is fired.</p>
	
	<h4>void stopUpload()</h4>

	<p>stopUpload stops and re-queues the file currently being uploaded.</p>
	<p>After the uploading file is stopped the uploadError event is fired. If no file is being uploaded then nothing happens and no event is fired.</p>
	
	<h4>object getStats()</h4>
	<p>Retrieves the stats object.</p>
	
	<h4>void setStats(<span class="parameter">stats_object</span>)</h4>
	<p>The Stats Object may be modified.  This is useful if you wish to change the number of successful uploads or upload errors after an upload
	has completed.</p>
	
	<h4>object getFile(<span class="parameter">file_id</span>|<span class="parameter">index</span>)</h4>
	<p>getFile is used to retrieve a File Object from the queue.  The file retrieved by passing in a file id (the id property from a file object) or a file index (the index property from a file object).</p>
	<p>When getting a file by file_id only files in the queue are available.  If the file is not found null is returned.</p>
	<p>When getting a file by index all queued (or files that generated a queue error) are available.  If the index is out of range then null is returned</p>
	
	<h4>bool addFileParam(<span class="parameter">file_id</span>, <span class="parameter">name, <span class="parameter">value</span>)</h4>
	<p>The addFileParam function adds a name/value pair that will be sent in the POST with the file specified by the file_id parameter.</p>
	<p>The name/value pair will only be sent with the file it is added to.  To send name/value pairs with all uploads use the post_param setting.</p>
	
	<h4>bool removeFileParam(<span class="parameter">file_id</span>, <span class="parameter">name</span>)</h4>
	<p>The removeFileParam function removes a name/value pair from a file upload that was added using addFileParam.</p>
	<p>If the name/value pair was not found then 'false' is returned.</p>
	
	
	<h4>void setUploadURL(<span class="parameter">url</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically modifies the upload_url setting.</p>
	
	<h4>void setPostParams(<span class="parameter">param_object</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically modifies the post_params setting.  Any previous values are over-written.  The param_object should be a simple JavaScript object.  All names and values must be strings.</p>

	<h4>void setFileTypes(<span class="parameter">types</span>, <span class="parameter">description</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically updates the file_types and file_types_description settings.  Both parameters are required.</p>
	
	<h4>void setFileSizeLimit(<span class="parameter">file_size_limit</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically modifies the file_size_limit setting. This applies to all future files that are queued.  The file_size_limit parameter should be in kilobytes.</p>
	
	<h4>void setFileUploadLimit(<span class="parameter">file_upload_limit</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically modifies the file_upload_limit setting. The special value zero (0) indicates "no limit".</p>

	<h4>void setFileQueueLimit(<span class="parameter">file_queue_limit</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically modifies the file_queue_limit setting. The special value zero (0) indicates "no limit".</p>

	<h4>void setFilePostName(<span class="parameter">file_post_name</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically modifies the file_post_name setting. The Linux Flash Player ignores this setting.</p>
	
	<h4>void setDebugEnabled(<span class="parameter">debug_enabled</span>)</h4>
	<p>Dynamically enables or disables debug output.  The debug_enabled parameter should be a boolean true or false.</p>

	<h3>Events</h3>
	<p>SWFUpload fires various events during its operation.  These events can be handled by the developer to update the UI, change behavior, or report errors.</p>
	<p>All SWFUpload events are called in the context of a SWFUpload instance.  This means that the 'this' object refers to the SWFUpload instance that
	fired the event.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">flashReady()</span></h4>
	<p>flashReady is an internal event that should not be overwritten.  It is called by the Flash Control to notify SWFUpload that the Flash
	movie has loaded and is ready to accept commands.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">swfUploadLoaded()</span></h4>
	<p>The swfUploadLoaded event is fired by flashReady.  It is overridable.  When swfUploadLoaded is called it is safe to call SWFUpload methods.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">fileDialogStart(<span class="parameter"></span>)</span></h4>
	<p>fileDialogStart is fired after selectFile for selectFiles is called. This event is fired immediately before the File Selection Dialog
	window is displayed. However, the event may not execute until after the Dialog window is closed.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">fileQueued(<span class="parameter">file object</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>The fileQueued event is fired for each file that is queued after the File Selection Dialog window is closed.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">fileQueueError(<span class="parameter">file object</span>, <span class="parameter">error code</span>, <span class="parameter">message</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>The fileQueueError event is fired for each file that was not queued after the File Selection Dialog window is closed.  A file may not not be queued
	for several reasons such as, the file exceeds the file size, the file is empty or a file or queue limit has been exceeded.</p>
	<p>The reason for the queue error is specified by the error code parameter.  The error code corresponds to SWFUpload.QUEUE_ERROR contant.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">fileDialogComplete(<span class="parameter">number of files selected</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>The fileDialogComplete event fires after the File Selection Dialog window has been closed and all the selected files have been processed.</p>
	<p>If you want file uploading to begin automatically this is a good place to call 'this.startUpload()'</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">uploadStart(<span class="parameter">file object</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>uploadStart is called immediately before the file is uploaded.  This event provides an oppurtunity to perform any last minute validation, add post
	params or do any other work before the file is uploaded.</p>
	
	<p>The upload can be cancelled by returning 'false' from uploadStart.  If you return 'true' or do not return any value then the upload proceeds.  Returning
	'false' will cause an uploadError event to fired.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">uploadProgress(<span class="parameter">file object</span>, <span class="parameter">bytes complete</span>, <span class="parameter">total bytes</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>The uploadProgress event is fired periodically by the Flash Control.  This event is useful for providing UI updates on the page.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Linux Flash Player fires a single uploadProgress event after the entire file has been uploaded.  This is a bug in
	the Linux Flash Player that we cannot work around.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">uploadError(<span class="parameter">file object</span>, <span class="parameter">error code</span>, <span class="parameter">message</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>The uploadError event is fired any time an upload is interrupted or does not complete successfully.  The error code parameter indicates the type of error
	that occurred. The error code parameter specifies a constant in SWFUpload.UPLOAD_ERROR.</p>
	<p>Stopping, Cancelling or returning 'false' from uploadStart will cause uploadError to fire.  Upload error will not fire for files that are cancelled
	but still waiting in the queue.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">uploadSuccess(<span class="parameter">file object</span>, <span class="parameter">server data</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>uploadSuccess is fired when an upload completes and the server returns a HTTP 200 status code.  Any data outputted by the server is available
	in the server data parameter (Flash Player 9 version only).</p>
	<p>At this point the upload is not yet complete.  Another upload cannot be started from uploadSuccess.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">uploadComplete(<span class="parameter">file object</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>uploadComplete is always fired at the end of an upload cycle (after uploadError or uploadSuccess).  At this point the upload is complete and
	another upload can be started.</p>
	<p>If you want the next upload to start automatically this is a good place to call this.uploadStart().  Use caution calling uploadStart inside
	the uploadComplete event if you are trying to cancel all the uploads in a queue.</p>
	
	<h4><span class="function">debug(<span class="parameter">message</span>)</span></h4>
	<p>The debug event is called by the SWFUpload library and the Flash Control when the debug setting is set to 'true'.  If the debug
	event is not overridden then SWFUpload writes debug messages to the SWFUpload console (a text box dynamically added to the end of the page body).</p>
	
	<h3>SWFUpload Utility Objects</h3>
	<h4>Settings object</h4>
	<p>The settings object is a JavaScript object that provides the settings for the SWFUpload instance. <strong>Each setting should only appear once.</strong>  Many settings
	are optional and provide suitable default values if omitted.  See the setting details for required and optional settings.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<code>{
	upload_url : "http://www.swfupload.org/upload.php",
	file_post_name : "Filedata",
	post_params : {
		"post_param_name_1" : "post_param_value_1",
		"post_param_name_2" : "post_param_value_2",
		"post_param_name_n" : "post_param_value_n"
	},
	file_types : "*.jpg;*.gif",
	file_types_description: "Web Image Files",

	<h4>File Object</h4>
	<p>The file object is passed to several event handlers.  It contains information about the file.</p>
	<code>{
	id : string,			// SWFUpload file id, used for starting or cancelling and upload
	index : number,			// The index of this file for use in getFile(i)
	name : string,			// The file name. The path is not included.
	size : number,			// The file size in bytes
	type : string,			// The file type as reported by the client operating system
	creationdate : Date,		// The date the file was created
	modificationdate : Date,	// The date the file was last modified
	filestatus : number,		// The file's current status. Use SWFUpload.FILE_STATUS to interpret the value.
	
}</code>

	<h4>Stats Object</h4>
	<p>The Stats object provides information about the upload queue.</p>
	<p>That stats object contains the following properties:</p>
	<code>{
	in_progress : number		// 1 or 0 indicating if a file upload is currently in progress
	files_queued : number		// The number of files currently in the queue
	successful_uploads : number	// The number of files that have uploaded successfully (caused uploadSuccess to be fired)
	upload_errors : number		// The number of files that have had errors (excluding cancelled files)
	upload_cancelled : number	// The number of files that have been cancelled
	queue_errors : number		// The number of files that caused fileQueueError to be fired
}</code>

	<h2>SWFUpload Plug-ins</h2>
	
	<p>With SWFUpload v2.0 several plugins have been introduced.  They are provided to help with common tasks associated with implementing SWFUpload.</p>
	<p>Currently most of the documentation for using the plugis is contained in the plugin JavaScript file.</p>
	
	<h3>Graceful Degradation</h3>
	
	<p>This plugin provides additional settings and logic for automatically hiding and showing page elements based on
	whether SWFUpload loads.</p>

	<h3>Document Ready</h3>
	<p>This plugin provides some functions for loading SWFUpload as soon as possible, rather than waiting until window.onload fires.
	This is similar to Document Ready functionality found in JavaScript Libraries like Prototype and jQuery.  It should not be mixed
	with other Document Ready libraries</p>
	
	<h3>SWFUpload v1.0.2 Compatibility</h3>
	<p>Creates compatibility with v1.0.2.  Using this plugin you should be able to drop SWFUpload v2.0 in to a v1.0.2 page</p>
	
	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>In response to the Flash Cookie Bug the Cookies Plugin automatically retrieves your browser's cookies and sends them
	with the uploads.  The are sent as POST or GET variables to the upload url.</p>
	
	<h3>Flash Detection Kit</h3>
	<p>This plugin is yet to be developed</p>
	<p>This plugin will implement Adobe's Flash Detection Kit for SWFUpload providing more advanced Flash Detection and upgrade features.</p>
	
	<h3>Queue Handling</h3>
	<p>This plugin provides Queue Handling features such as entire queue uploading, entire queue cancelling and automatic starting of uploads after being queued.</p>

	<hr />
	<h2>Known Issues</h2>
	<p>The Flash Player and many Browsers have bugs that have a direct impact on the performance of SWFUpload.  While we have worked
	hard to get around many issues there are some things we cannot fix.</p>
	<h3>Cancelling in Linux</h3>
	<p>Flash 8 and older Flash 9 Players for Linux cause the browser to crash if an upload is cancelled.  Newer Flash 9 Players behave better.</p>
	<h3>Progress in Linux</h3>
	<p>The Flash Player in Linux sends a single uploadProgress event after the file has finished uploading.</p>
	<h3>Proxies</h3>
	<p>The Flash Player may not properly use proxies.  It does not handle authenticating proxies well (if at all) and will some-times crash.</p>
	<p>Some anti-virus software uses a proxy to scan uploads and cause SWFUpload to believe the entire file has been uploaded.  SWFUpload will fire uploadProgress events very quickly
	and will then wait until the proxy completes its upload.</p>
	<h3>Apache mod_security</h3>
	<p>Apache's mod_security validates POST to the server.  Flash Player has implemented an invalid POST for file uploads and so servers implementing
	mod_security will reject the upload.  mod_security can be disabled using your .htaccess file</p>
	<h3>SSL</h3>
	<p>There have been some reports that the Flash Player cannot upload through SSL.  The issue has not been pinned down but uploading over SSL may be unreliable.</p>
	<h3>Authentication</h3>
	<p>HTTP Authentication is not well supported by Flash Player.  Later versions of Flash Player behave better.  Old version of Flash Player would crash the browser.</p>
	<h3>Prematurely terminated connections</h3>
	<p>Prematurely ending the response (such as a Response.end() in ASP.Net) can sometimes cause successful uploads to be reported as failed.</p>
	<h3>Filedata in Linux</h3>
	<p>The Filedata value (file_post_name setting) is ignored in Linux Flash Player</p>
	<h3>uploadSuccess &amp; Server Data</h3>
	<p>The uploadSuccess will not fire if no data is returned from the server.  This is especially problematic on the Mac Flash Player.</p>
	<h3>Cookie issue</h3>
	<p>On Windows the Non-IE Flash Player plugin (FireFox, Opera, Safari, etc) sends the IE cookes regardless of the browser used.  This breaks authentication and sessions for many server-side scripting technologies.</p>
	<p>Developers should manually pass Session ID information and manually restore Sessions on the Server Side if they wish to use Sessions</p>
	<h3>ExternalInterface bugs</h3>
	<p>Flash Player does not properly escape data when communication with the browser/JavaScript.  SWFUpload goes to great lengths to work-around this issue.  If this
	bug is fixed in future Flash Players/Browsers then SWFUpload will send extra escaped data.</p>
	<h3>Server Data length bugs</h3>
	<p>Very long server data is corrupted on Mac and Linux Flash Players.  Server data will be truncated, garbled, and/or repeated.  We recommend
	keeping data returned from the server short and concise.</p>

	<h2>Using the Events</h2>
	<p>Events should only be overridden using the settings object.  They cannot be overridden dynamically.  Overridding the events directly on the instance
	can break the event call safety mechanisms built in to SWFUpload.</p>
