	<h1>SWFUpload Revision 7 Documentation</h1>
	<h2>SWFUpload</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://swfupload.mammon.se">SWFUpload</a> is a tool/widget/control developed by <a href="http://www.mammon.se">Mammon.se</a>. It uses a combination Flash and JavaScript to
		provide file upload functionality beyond what the basic browser provides with &lt;input type="file" /&gt;
	</p>
	<p>The main features that SWFUpload are:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Select multiple files in the file browser dialog.</li>
			<li>AJAX-style upload without a page refresh</li>
			<li>Upload progress indicator</li>
			<li>Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers.</li>
			<li>Namespaced classes compatible with other JavaScript libraries (i.e., jQuery, Prototype, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The philosophy behind the design of SWFUpload is what makes it different from other Flash based upload tools.  SWFUpload leaves developers in control by leaving the UI in the browser.
		Developers can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tailer the upload UI to the needs of their site.  Upload status updates are made through a set of simple set of JavaScript events that
		the developer overrides in order to update the webpage as need for their site.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Revision 7</h2>
	<p>Revision 7 is an extended version of SWFUpload that adds a number of features not found in the official SWFUpload release.  These include:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ability to send additional POST values with the upload.</li>
			<li>Send per file POST values.</li>
			<li>More refined JavaScript events.</li>
			<li>Ability to update any SWFUpload settings dynamically.</li>
			<li>Retrieve result data from the server.</li>
			<li>Work-arounds for bugs in Flash not addressed in the official version.</li>
			<li>Stop an upload without cancelling.</li>
			<li>Upload files out of order.</li>
			<li>Multi- &amp; Single-file selection dialogs.</li>
			<li>Bug fixes for issues discussed in the SWFUpload forums:</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>Flash fails to load on reload in I.E.</li>
					<li>Flash fails to load on reload in Firefox unless the windows is scrolled back to the top.</li>
					<li>Other misc race-conditions</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Prevents user from queueing more files than they are allowed to upload.</li>
			<li>Properly handles zero-byte files.</li>
			<li>uploadStart event allows JavaScript validation before the upload begins.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Revision 7 is a complete re-write of the SWFUpload code.  At Revision 4 code was submitted back to the SWFUpload developers which resulted in SWFUpload v1.0.2.  The &quot;Revisions&quot;
		have under semi-active development while SWFUpload development has slowed/stopped.
	</p>
	<p>
		Revision 7 continues the SWFUpload design goal of leaving the UI in the hands of developers and pushes it even further. While SWFUpload provides a default style-able UI Revision 7 provides
		no UI features.

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<h3>HTML Upload</h3>
	<p>
		The standard HTML upload input box provides a box and a button to the user for selecting a file.  The file is submitted with the form.  The entire file must be uploaded before the next
		page is displayed.  No pre-upload validation can be made on the file (e.g., file size limits or valid extensions).
	</p>
	<p>
		The usage pattern for standard HTML uploads is simple, straight forward, and supported by nearly all browser.
	</p>
	<h3>SWFUpload</h3>
	<p>
		SWFUpoad uses a hidden Flash movie to handle file selection and upload.  JavaScript is used to activate the file selection dialog.  The file selection dialog is configured to allow the user
		select only one file or multiple files.  The file types can be restricted so users only select the appropriate files (e.g., *.jpg;*.gif).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once files are selected each is processed to check for valid file extensions and that the file is within size limits.  Flash calls several pre-defined JavaScript functions which
		the developer overrides in order to update the page UI so users can see file progress or errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		The uploaded file is submitted separately from the rest of the page and form.  Each file is uploaded separately which keeps the server-side upload handling script simple as it only ever
		has to handle a single uploaded file at a time. Since Flash is providing the upload service the page does not have to be reloaded (behaving very much like
		AJAX).  The usage pattern for SWFUpload is more like that of an AJAX application than that of standard HTML form.  Often the server-side script that receives the uploaded file is
		different than the target of the page's form.  The page's form will be processed separately from the file upload.
