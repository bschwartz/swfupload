	<h1>SWFUpload Revision 7 Documentation</h1>
	<h2>SWFUpload</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://swfupload.mammon.se">SWFUpload</a> is a client-side tool developed by <a href="http://www.mammon.se">Mammon.se</a>. It uses a combination Flash and JavaScript to
		provide file upload functionality beyond what the basic browser provides with &lt;input type="file" /&gt;
	</p>
	<p>The main features that SWFUpload provides are:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Select multiple files in the file browser dialog.</li>
			<li>AJAX-style uploading without a page refresh.</li>
			<li>Upload progress indicator.</li>
			<li>Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers.</li>
			<li>Namespaced classes compatible with other JavaScript libraries (i.e., jQuery, Prototype, etc.).</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		SWFUpload is differentiated from other Flash based upload tools by the philosophy
		behind its design.  SWFUpload gives developers control by leaving the UI in the browser.
		Developers can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tailer the upload UI to the needs and
		style of their site.  Upload status updates are made through a set of simple JavaScript events.
		The developer uses these events to update the webpage as need for their site.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Revision 7</h2>
	<p>
		Revision 7 is an extended version of SWFUpload that adds a number of features not found
		in the official SWFUpload release.  These include:
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The ability to send additional POST values with the uploads.</li>
			<li>Sending per file POST values.</li>
			<li>More refined JavaScript events.</li>
			<li>The ability to update SWFUpload settings dynamically.</li>
			<li>Retrieve result data from the server.</li>
			<li>Stop an upload without cancelling.</li>
			<li>Upload files out of order.</li>
			<li>Multi- &amp; Single-file selection dialogs.</li>
			<li>Prevents user from queueing more files than they are allowed to upload.</li>
			<li>Properly handles zero-byte files.</li>
			<li>JavaScript validation before the upload begins.</li>
			<li>Work-arounds for bugs in Flash not addressed in the official version.</li>
			<li>Bug fixes for issues discussed in the SWFUpload forums:</li>
			<li>
				<ul>
					<li>Flash fails to load on reload in I.E.</li>
					<li>Flash fails to load on reload in Firefox unless the windows is scrolled back to the top.</li>
					<li>Other misc race-conditions.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Revision 7 is a complete re-write of the SWFUpload (v0.8.3) code.  At Revision 4 the code was submitted back to the
		SWFUpload developers which resulted in SWFUpload v1.0.2.  The &quot;Revisions&quot; have continued under active development
		while Official SWFUpload development has slowed/stopped.
	</p>
	<p>
		Revision 7 continues the SWFUpload design goal of leaving the UI in the hands of developers and extends it even further.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<h3>HTML Upload</h3>
	<p>
		The standard HTML upload input box provides a box and a button to the user for selecting a file.
		The file is submitted with the form.  The entire file must be uploaded before the next
		page is displayed.  No pre-upload validation can be made on the file (e.g., file size limits or valid extensions).
		Very little feedback is given to the user while the file uploads.
	</p>
	<p>
		The usage pattern for standard HTML uploads is simple, straight forward, and supported by nearly all browser.
	</p>
	<h3>SWFUpload</h3>
	<p>
		SWFUpoad uses a hidden Flash movie to handle file selection and upload.  JavaScript is used to activate the file selection dialog.
		The file selection dialog is configured to allow the user select to a single file or to multiple files.
		The file types can be restricted so users only select the appropriate files (e.g., *.jpg;*.gif).
	</p>
	<p>
		Once files are selected each is processed to check for valid file extensions and that the file is within size limits.
		Flash calls several pre-defined JavaScript callback functions which the developer overrides in order to update the
		page's UI so users can see file progress or errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		The uploaded file is submitted separately from the rest of the page and form.  Each file is uploaded
		individually which keeps the server-side upload handling script simple as it only ever has to handle a
		single uploaded file at a time. Since Flash is providing the upload service the page does not have to
		be reloaded.  The usage pattern for SWFUpload is more like that of an AJAX application than that of
		standard HTML form.  Often the server-side script that receives the uploaded file is different than
		the target of the page's form.  The page's form will be processed separately from the file upload.

	<h2>SWFUpload JavaScript Object</h2>

	<h3>Constructor</h3>

	<p><span class="function">SWFUpload(<span class="parameter">settings object</span>)</span></p>
	<p><b>Returns:</b> A SWFUpload instance</p>
	<h3>Settings object</h3>
	<p>The settings object provides the settings your SWFUpload instance will use upon initialization.</p>

	<h2>Initializing SWFUpload</h2>
	<p>Example of creating an instance.  Talk about using customSettings.  Talk about overriding swfUploadLoaded and ui_container_id, degraded_container_id.</p>

	<h2>Interacting with the SWFUpload instance</h2>
	
	<hr />
	<h2>Using the Events</h2>
	<p>Events should only be overridden using the settings object.  They cannot be overridden dynamically.  Overridding the events directly on the instance
	will break the event call safety mechanisms built in to SWFUpload.</p>
	<p>Talk in detail about each event and what kind of things can/should be done in each</p>
